# Using the Command, \n will create a new line.

print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello World!")

# We can concatenate strings, via the use of operators, such as +.

print("Hello" + " " + "World!")
print("Hello " + "World!")

# If we think of strings as a stream of connected characters, then String Concatenation is simply taking those
